What are Access Bars(r)?

The Bars are 32 bars of energy that run through and around your head that connect to different aspects of your life. We call all of the points you touch when using this modality "The Bars." 

The Bars store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything. For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called "money."

There are Bars for healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money; 32 different ones in all. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named. Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it. 

How much of your life do you spend doing rather than receiving? 

Have you noticed that your life is not yet what you would like it to be? 

How would your life change if you were willing to start receiving more? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dbdbe763-6485-4054-9496-7e2c9717405d.png)
