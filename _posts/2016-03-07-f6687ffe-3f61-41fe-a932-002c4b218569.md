# Why Choose Me?

What if I am all of the things you already are and all the ways you'd like to be? What if the broken pieces in you are places I believed I was broken too? What if the capacities in me are the capacities in you and what if looking through the window, it isn't me you see, it is yourself? 

and 

What could be possible if you chose to play with me? 

In everything I facilitate, I lived and in every place of change, I have changed. It's ongoing choice and I am writing my story everyday. If I can share a chapter and reach one person, who changes one thing, that brings in more light, I have done what I set out to do.
