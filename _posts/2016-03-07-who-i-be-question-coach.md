# Who Is Michelle Lyall

I was born a seeker, a question asker and a non-conformist. Always sure there was something more, something greater and infinite possibility. This allowed me the drive to pursue.

* Educationally,
* Experientially
* PersonallyI can list the credentials, that list is long and I believed for a long time, credentials mattered.

What really matters isn't my education, my experience or even my capacity to assist you. What matters is whether you are drawn to work with me, that is the place where we meet, where change is possible.

I have traveled to the darkest places of my being and danced in the light, fought, survived, created, destroyed, sought, found, died, re-birthed and awakened to my authentic self only to discover the lies, the story and the mind all taunting me. One day my world was changed through the simple idea of choice and joy found permanent residence in my body dancing with my being.

## Would You Like A Session?

I will not tell you what you know, I will ask you to know what you know.

How much have you been seeking the answers and listening to others looking for what is right for you, buying the stuff that doesn't work? I do not have the answers, I have the capacity to listen, the awareness to ask significant questions and the patience to sit in allowance of your truth.

Would you like some of that, infinite joy?

I was gifted a Bars(r) session that changed my life and opened my world to Access Consciousness(r). These tools expose all the places where being the question is wrong and anywhere I am still held hostage by old patterns. You can can choose this too, schedule a session today....
